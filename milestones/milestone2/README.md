## How I addressed the feedback
I read the feedback and was happy with my work :)

# Milestone 2
- CST-391
- Milestone Project Proposal
- Nathan McMahon

I will be creating a website to list cars. The site will allow an admin-user to view a home page, and navigate from Home to a Car Product page. From the Product page, the admin will be able to create, delete, and edit the cars. 

## User Story
1. **Support Product in MySQL Database**
 - As a system user, I want the system to support a product, which is any object represented as a class with multiple properties. The product should include properties with at least three different data types in the MySQL database.
 2. **Implement CRUD Operations**
 - As a user of the web application, I want the ability to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a "product." This includes listing existing products, creating new products, viewing details of a product, updating product information, and deleting a product.
 3. **Design and Develop Back-end Services**
 - As a developer, I want to design and develop back-end services using Express and NodeJS. These services will be used by two front-end web applications. The implementation of the REST API should act as a facade over any business logic required to process back-end data and interact with the MySQL relational database.
 4. **Create Angular Web Application**
 - As a developer, I want to design and develop a front-end web application using the Angular JavaScript Framework. The web application should be integrated with the REST APIs developed using Express.
 5. **Create React Web Application**
 - As a developer, I want to redeploy the front-end web application using the React JavaScript Framework. This aims to provide flexibility and options for users who prefer using the React framework.
 6. **Document Technical Decisions and Designs**
 - As a team member, I want to document all technical decisions and designs in a design report. This report will capture appropriate UML diagrams, ER diagrams, UI designs, and other technical artifacts necessary to support the design of the end-to-end solution and application.

 ### Er Diagram

 ### Wireframes

 ### UML Classes

 #### Unknowns and Risks
 The unknowns and risks are that I have never done this type of application in javascript, only java and c#. I am not sure how the technicalities will change using a different language.

 ## Rest API
 My rest api is gonna be a simple product API that uses

 - GET
 - POST
 - PUT
 - DELETE
